"""
A certain food-based company conducted a survey with the help of a fitness company 
to find the relationship between a personâ€™s weight gain and the number of calories 
they consumed in order to come up with diet plans for these individuals. 
Build a Simple Linear Regression model with calories consumed as the target variable.
Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient 
values for different models. 

Business Problem:
What is the business objective?
If people consumed only the number of calories needed every day, 
they would probably have healthy lives.
Calorie consumption that is too low or too high will eventually lead to health problems.
prediction of The number of calories in food tells us how much potential energy they contain. 
It is not only calories that are important,but also the substance from which the calories are taken.

Are there any constraints?
It also appears that weight regain occurs regardless of the type of diet used 
for weight loss, although some diets are linked to less regain than others.
